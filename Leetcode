Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

class Solution(object):
    def runningSum(self, nums):



        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            nums[i] += nums[i-1]
        return nums 


You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. 
Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. 
The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.


class Solution(object):
    def maximumWealth(self, accounts):
        max_wealth = 0
        for i in range(len(accounts)):
            max_wealth = max(sum(accounts[i]), max_wealth)
        
        return max_wealth




412. Fizz Buzz

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.


class Solution(object):
    def fizzBuzz(self, n):

        a=[]
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            if i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0:
              a.append ("FizzBuzz")

            elif i%3 == 0: 
              a.append ("Fizz")

            elif i%5 == 0: 
              a.append ("Buzz")

            else: 
                a.append (str(i))
        return a
